## Hi ! I'm Sebastián

chilean, <strong style="color:#E91E63">applied mathematician</strong>, living in France after having worked as <strong style="color:#303F9F">postdoctoral researcher at Géoazur CNRS</strong>. Before that, I got a <strong>PhD</strong> and an <strong>M2</strong> degree in Applied Mathematics from Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, and a <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong> degree from Universidad de Chile.
					
My research focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms for <strong style="color:#E91E63">solving differential equations</strong> through <strong style="color:#0288D1">Domain Decomposition Methods</strong> (Parareal, Schwarz), with possible applications to <strong style="color:#0288D1">optimization</strong> and <strong style="color:#0288D1">data assimilation</strong> problems. I'm curious about scientific computing.

In a more personal note, among my hobbies are photography, biking, reading and traveling. I'm quite interested in politics.
