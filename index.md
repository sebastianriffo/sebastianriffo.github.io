### Hi, I'm Sebastián !

Chilean, <strong style="color:#E91E63">applied mathematician</strong>, formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Pierre-Simon Laplace Institute (IPSL), as part of the <a href="https://orchidee.ipsl.fr/" target="_blank" style="color:#303F9F">ORCHIDEE project<a/>. I earned a <strong>PhD</strong> and an <strong>M2</strong> degree in Applied Mathematics from Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, and a degree in <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong> from Universidad de Chile. 


I'm attracted by the opportunity to collaborate on <strong style="color:#303F9F">interdisciplinary initiatives</strong>, particularly those related to algorithm design, data analytics, and modeling. Interested in visualization and politics, I'm also running a project dedicated to <a href="https://sebastianriffo.github.io/congreso-chile/en/home.html" style="color:#0288D1" target="_blank"> chilean parliamentary election maps</a>.
