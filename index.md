### Hi ! I'm Sebastián

chilean, <strong style="color:#E91E63">applied mathematician</strong>, living in France after being a <strong style="color:#303F9F">postdoc at Géoazur CNRS</strong>. Before that, I got a <strong>PhD</strong> and an <strong>M2</strong> degree in Applied Mathematics from Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, and a <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong> degree from Universidad de Chile.

I'm interested in working within a <strong style="color:#303F9F">multidisciplinary team</strong>, on problems related with algorithm design, <strong style="color:#0288D1">data science and visualization</strong>; as well as mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and optimization. I'm also curious about scientific computing. 

<!--
In the last few years, my research focused on the development and analysis of algorithms for <strong style="color:#E91E63">solving differential equations</strong> through <strong style="color:#0288D1">Domain Decomposition Methods</strong> (Parareal, Schwarz), with possible applications to <strong style="color:#0288D1">data assimilation</strong> and <strong style="color:#0288D1">imaging</strong> problems.
-->

In a more personal note, among my hobbies are photography, biking, reading and traveling. I'm quite interested in politics.
