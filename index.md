### Hi, I'm Sebastián !

Chilean, <strong style="color:#E91E63">applied mathematician</strong>, currently working as postdoctoral researcher at the Pierre-Simon Laplace Institute, within the <a href="https://orchidee.ipsl.fr/" target="_blank" style="color:#303F9F">ORCHIDEE project<a/>. I earned a <strong>PhD</strong> and an <strong>M2</strong> degree in Applied Mathematics from Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, and a degree in <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong> from Universidad de Chile. 


I'm attracted by the opportunity to collaborate on <strong style="color:#303F9F">interdisciplinary initiatives</strong>, particularly those related to algorithm design, data analytics, and mathematical modeling. As part of my interest in visualization and politics, I'm also running a project dedicated to <a href="https://sebastianriffo.github.io/congreso-chile/en/home.html" style="color:#0288D1" target="_blank"> chilean parliamentary election maps</a>.


<!--
I'm also curious about scientific computing. 

In the last few years, my research focused on the development and analysis of algorithms for <strong style="color:#E91E63">solving differential equations</strong> through <strong style="color:#0288D1">Domain Decomposition Methods</strong> (Parareal, Schwarz), with possible applications to <strong style="color:#0288D1">data assimilation</strong> and <strong style="color:#0288D1">imaging</strong> problems.

On a more personal note, among my hobbies are cycling, reading, genealogy, and photography. 
-->
